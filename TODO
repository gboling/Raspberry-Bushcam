check if camera is already in use and call exception if so.
encode to mp4 from stream instead of a file to cut down on disk writes
add a countdown to the warmup sequence
echo basic configuration at startup (resolution, length per recording)
implement verbose output
add logging options
    add disk space WARNING when we get to 2x DISK_FREE_LIMIT -- should send an email
    stop avconv writing to stdout, make it DEBUG level
    separate loggers for PIR, video transodes, and temp/humidity

write backup script:
	user configurable backup frequency (hours/days/weeks)
	check for unencoded files and encode them (will be moot once stream encoding is written)
	copy files that are newer than the last backup
	verify they made it and delete the old ones

handle running modules as stand-alone and give them useful cli guidance.

Is it possible to hack apart a cheap solar charging usb battery such that the
capacity and charge rate can be monitored? Can a generalized process be described?
